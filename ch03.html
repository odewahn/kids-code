<h1>Let’s get started!</h1>


<p>What the first thing we’re going to need to do in order to start coding? We’re going to have to install Python!</p>

<p>Don’t worry: Installing Python is super easy. It may even already be on your computer. We’re also going to over different ways to edit and run our code.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What you’re going to need" id="_what_you_re_going_to_need">
<h1>What you’re going to need</h1>

<p>For this section, you’re going to need:</p>

<p><strong>A computer.</strong> You’ll need to be able to install things onto your computer. If someone else has to enter a password in order for you to install new things, make sure you have them on hand.</p>

<p><strong>An Internet connection.</strong> You’re going to need to download Python in order to install it.</p>
<div data-type="note">
<h1>Python 2 vs Python 3</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of Python being used at the moment: Python 2 and Python 3. We’re going to be using Python 2.</p>

<p>Why? When learning a new language, you’ll probably find yourself searching the Internet for problems you’re having. Python 2 wins there simply because it’s been around for longer. It’s also very stable, meaning that there are relatively few changes being made to it today.</p>

<p>Once you pick up Python 2, Python 3 is super easy to pick up. There are even scripts out there that help you move your code over from Python 2 to Python 3!</p>

</div>
</section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Installing Python" id="_installing_python">
<h1>Installing Python</h1>

<p>Let’s install Python! First, though, we need to figure out what operating system is installed on your computer.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="What’s an operating system?" id="_what_s_an_operating_system">
<h2>What’s an operating system?</h2>

<p>An operating system is a collection of programs that works with the hardware of your computer (that’s the stuff you can touch). So, your operating system helps images appear on your monitor, or knows that when you move your mouse or touch your touchpad that you want to move the cursor. It’s a layer between the programs you want to run (like games, browsers, or word processing programs) and the physical part of the machine.</p>

<p>More than likely, you’re running one of the two major operating systems.</p>
</section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Windows" id="_windows">
<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>If you have a computer that has Start menu or Start screen, then you’re running Windows. One of the screenshots in Figure X.X should look familiar.</p>

<figure id="windows_shots">
<img src="images/windows_shots.png" alt="Default sceenshots of three Windows desktops"/>
<figcaption>Screenshots of Windows XP, 7, and 8</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you are, in fact, running Windows, go ahead and download Python from <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python.org’s download page</a>.</p>

<p>Python will run on nearly every version of Windows out there, but the download page has multiple versions available. You’re going to need to search for the link that says something like “Python 2.7.6 Windows Installer”.</p>
<div data-type="note">


<p>The version numbers might change slightly. Just make sure that the first number is a two!</p>

</div>

<p>Installing it should be pretty easy. Once the file has downloaded, click on the installer and follow the instructions. If you get stuck or nervous, I’ve included a video here that goes through the process step-by-step and explains what each screen means.</p>

<p>TODO: Video</p>

<p>Once you’re done installing Python, check out your installed applications. On XP and 7, you can click on the Start button. On Windows 8, you can hit your Windows key and type <em>Python</em> to bring up your Python applications.</p>

<figure id="idle_icon">
<img src="images/idle_icon.png" alt="IDLE's icon, as seen in Windows 8"/>
<figcaption>The icon for IDLE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the applications is called IDLE. That’s what we’ll be working in for the rest of this book, so make sure you can start that up before you move on.</p>
</section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Mac OS" id="_mac_os">
<h2>Mac OS</h2>

<p>If you have a computer that has a glowing apple on it or an Apple on the toolbar (check out Figure X.X), then you’re on a Mac! And guess what? Python is already installed! You won’t see it as an application in your Applications folder, but it’s there, trust me.</p>

<figure id="mac_spotlight">
<img src="images/spotlight.png" alt="A user is searching for Adobe using Spotlight"/>
<figcaption>Mac’s spotlight menu at work</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before we move on, we want to make sure that Python is working. First, you’ll need to bring up something called a Terminal. Search for Terminal in your Spotlight (the magnifying glass on your toolbar). When you click on it, a window should pop up that looks something like the screenshot in Figure X.X.</p>

<figure id="mac_terminal">
<img src="images/terminal.png" alt="Screen shot of my mac terminal window"/>
<figcaption>Mac Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the terminal window, type the word <em>idle</em>. An applicaiton called IDLE should open up. Remember how to do this, because we’re going to be working in IDLE for the rest of the book!</p>

<p>If you’re confused, here’s a video, showing me getting a terminal window and opening up IDLE.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="IDLE" id="_idle">
<h1>IDLE</h1>

<p>By now, no matter what operating system you’re on, you should have IDLE up. What is IDLE?</p>

<p>IDLE is an application that comes with Python that makes it easier for you to write and run code. It has two parts: The interpreter, and the editor. Right now, you probably have the interpreter open (there should be a prompt that looks like this: “&gt;&gt;&gt;”). To open the editor, go to File &gt; New. A blank window should open.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/idle-intepreter.png" alt="A screenshot of the IDLE intepreter"/>
<figcaption>The IDLE interpreter</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/idle-editor.png" alt="A screenshot of the IDLE editor"/>
<figcaption>The IDLE editor</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The interpreter is like a live wire. Python is sitting there, listening, waiting for you go give it a command. Once you give it a command, it will run it right away, then wait for the next command.</p>

<p>The interpreter is like a bumbling minion. The second you tell it to do something, it runs off and does it! So, if you had ten things for it to do, you’re going to have to wait around until it comes back so you can give it your next command.</p>

<p>The editor is used to create Python files, which allow you to write out a series of commands and save them. Once you’ve saved the Python file, you can run it,a nd the results will show up in the interpreter.</p>

<p>The editor is like working with a better trained minion. This one, you can give a list of things to do, and it will only come back if it had trouble or if it’s done with all its tasks.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Working in the Interpreter" id="_working_in_the_interpreter">
<h2>Working in the Interpreter</h2>

<p>Let’s play around in the interpreter for a bit. Try typing out the following:</p>


<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python"><code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <code class="k">print</code> <code class="s">"Hello, world"</code></pre>


<p>Hit enter. Python should have immediately printed out <em>Hello, world</em> on the next line. Your interpreter should look something like this:</p>


<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python"><code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <code class="k">print</code> <code class="s">"Hello, world"</code>
<code class="n">Hello</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="n">world</code>
<code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Those greater than signs (&gt;&gt;&gt;) mean that Python is ready for another command.</p>
</section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Working in a file" id="_working_in_a_file">
<h2>Working in a file</h2>

<p>Let’s try saving some code into a file and running it. Open the text editor by going to File &gt; New. In the window, type the following:</p>


<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python"><code class="k">print</code> <code class="s">"Hello, world"</code></pre>


<p>Save the file as <em>hello.py</em>, but don’t close it. Instead, go to Run &gt; Run Module. Then go back to see what happened in the interpreter. You should see the following:</p>


<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python"><code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <code class="o">=======</code> <code class="n">RESTART</code> <code class="o">=======</code>
<code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<code class="n">Hello</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="n">world</code>
<code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>


<p>You can run this file again and again, which is a definite advantage over just typing stuff in the interpreter! Usually, I use the shell for when I want to mess around and test stuff, and Python files for the lines of code I want to save.</p>

<h1>Working in the book!</h1>

<p>Every once in a while, you might notice a box that looks a bit like a shell, or that has some code in it. If the box looks like the one below, you can actually change and run that code!</p>

<p>TODO: Explain how it works</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Try this!" id="_try_this">
<h1>Try this!</h1>

<p>Try entering the following things into your interpreter:</p>


<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python"><code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <code class="mi">5</code> <code class="o">+</code> <code class="mi">1</code>
<code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <code class="n">a</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">5</code>
<code class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> <code class="k">print</code> <code class="n">a</code></pre>


<p>Check out that last line of code. What did Python print out when you entered <code>print a</code>? Why do you think it printed out what it did?</p>
</section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Notes for the adult" id="_notes_for_the_adult">
<h1>Notes for the adult</h1>

<p>In this lesson, we’re going to get Python installed and get the student familiar with working with IDLE.</p>

<p>Even if you’re a Python developer, you’ve probably never touched IDLE. Most developers I chat with at conferences aren’t even aware that Python comes with an IDE! It’s a great environment for beginners, though, because it comes with some great stuff out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no messing with paths. Run it and go! If the student is on Windows, this can be a huge boon to them. So many students get stuck on paths!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has tab completion! Getting tab completion is easy enough for experts to set up, but can be intimidating for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It comes with color coding. I know some old-school programmers hate it, but color coding can really help a beginner understand syntax and gives them a feeling of confidence as the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It comes with Python. One install, and we’re ready to go!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop down menus allow the student to explore what methods and attributes various objects have. Even the docs show up as you mouse over the various options!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You probably will want to take a while to get familiar with IDLE, since that’s where I have the student work. Some of the stuff that might throw you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pressing the up arrow moves your cursor up rather than bringing up a previous command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your cursor is on a previously entered code, hitting enter will paste that code at your prompt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can’t seem to type, your cursor is probably just slightly off of where it needs to be. Hit enter or use the mouse to move the cursor to where it needs to be (which is right in front of the prompt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, if you create a block, IDLE will indent for you, but you won’t get the usual three dots indicating that you’re in a block. You’ll just be missing the usual prompt.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If students get stuck here, it’s usually because they’re not used to being precise. Remind them to type in everything <strong>just</strong> as I’ve shown, down to the punctuation marks. Another place they get stuck is that they try to enter the prompt in as code, so watch out for that.</p>

<p>Let them play around with the shell and such, printing out various things, until they’re comfortable enough to move on to the next lesson.</p>
